        "Explanation for correct option": "The angular width of the central maximum in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. The angle θ is given by sin(θ) ≈ θ = λ/a, where λ is the wavelength of light and a is the width of the slit. Given λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10^-9 m and a = 1 × 10^-6 m, θ = (500 × 10^-9 m) / (1 × 10^-6 m) = 0.5 radians. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. However, the question asks for the angular width of the central maximum, which is 2*λ/a. So, 2* (500 * 10^-9)/(1*10^-6) = 1. The angle to the first minimum is given by  λ/a = 500*10^-9/1*10^-6= 0.5 rad. The angular width of the central maximum is 2*0.5=1 radian. The question is asking for the angular width of the central maximum which is 2θ,  where θ is the angle to the first minimum. The angle θ is given by sin(θ) ≈ θ = λ/a, where λ is the wavelength of light and a is the width of the slit. Given λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10^-9 m and a = 1 × 10^-6 m, θ = (500 × 10^-9 m) / (1 × 10^-6 m) = 0.5 radians. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The question asks for the angular width of the central maximum, which is 2θ.  2θ = 2 * (λ/a) = 2 * (500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6) = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian.  The angular width of the central maximum is 2 * (λ/a) = 2 * (500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6) = 1 radian. The correct answer is therefore 1 radian.
