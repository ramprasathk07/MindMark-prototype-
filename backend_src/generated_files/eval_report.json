        "Negative Feedback": "Consider revisiting the key concepts related to this question. Your selected answer suggests a potential misunderstanding. You need to review the fundamental concepts of differentiation in the context of kinematics. Pay close attention to the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration. Practice more problems to solidify your understanding of these concepts."

        "Negative Feedback": "Consider revisiting the key concepts related to this question. Your selected answer suggests a potential misunderstanding. The student needs to review the concepts of resolving forces on inclined planes. They should focus on understanding why the sine of the angle is used to calculate the acceleration down the plane and practice more problems on inclined planes."

They may also fail to recognize that a change in direction results in acceleration, even if the speed is constant. The concept of centripetal acceleration is often misunderstood or missed.",
        "Negative Feedback": "Consider revisiting the key concepts related to this question. Your selected answer suggests a potential misunderstanding. You need to review the concepts of velocity and acceleration in the context of circular motion. Pay special attention to the fact that velocity is a vector and a change in direction means acceleration, even if the speed is constant. Review the concept of centripetal acceleration."
