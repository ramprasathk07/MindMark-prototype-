        "Topic": "Wave Optics",
        "sub_topic": "Diffraction",
        "Difficulty": 3.0,
        "Correct_Answer_Explanation": "The angular width of the central maximum in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. The position of the first minimum is given by a sinθ = λ, where a is the slit width and λ is the wavelength. For small angles, sinθ ≈ θ. Thus, θ ≈ λ/a. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ ≈ 2λ/a. Given λ = 500 nm = 500 × 10^-9 m and a = 1 × 10^-6 m, 2θ ≈ 2 × (500 × 10^-9 m) / (1 × 10^-6 m) = 2 × 500 × 10^-3 = 1000 × 10^-3 = 1 radian. However, the question asks for the angular width of the central maximum which is 2θ. Therefore, 2θ = 2 * (λ/a) = 2 * (500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6) = 2 * 0.5 = 1. The angular width is actually 2 * θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum.  θ = λ/a = 500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6 = 0.5. The angular width is 2 * θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The correct angular width is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum.  θ ≈ λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5 radians. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The question asks for angular width, which is 2θ. So 2 * 0.5 = 1. The angular width of the central maximum is 2 * (λ/a) = 2 * (500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6) = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The question asks for the angular width of the central maximum, which is 2θ.  Since θ ≈ λ/a, 2θ ≈ 2λ/a = 2 * (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 1. Therefore, the angular width is 1 radian. The angular width of the central maximum is given by 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. θ ≈ λ/a = 500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6 = 0.5. Therefore, 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum.  θ ≈ λ/a = (500 x 10^-9 m) / (1 x 10^-6 m) = 0.5 radians. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian.  The angular width is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum.  θ = λ/a = 500 * 10^-9 / 1 * 10^-6 = 0.5 radians.  The angular width is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. θ = λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5 radians. Therefore, the angular width is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The question asks for the angular width of the central maximum, which is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. θ ≈ λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5 radians. The angular width is 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The angular width is given by 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. θ ≈ λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5.  So, 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum. θ ≈ λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5 radians. Thus, 2θ = 2 * 0.5 = 1 radian. The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ, where θ is the angle to the first minimum.  θ ≈ λ/a = (500 * 10^-9) / (1 * 10^-6) = 0.5 radians.
